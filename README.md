# Student-buddy
As Our Sem4 Project, we planned to create an java Desktop Application to assist students in getting to know about and connect with nearby common services a student needs such as Nearby Hotels, Canteens, Stationary Shops, etc. But as this was our first offline semester, we failed to manage our studies properly and ended up working on this project for last few days only. Hence it doesn't have something very solid to look upon, but I would like to mention things we managed to do.

We created the login and signup page and basic interface for student sign-in to start with. We created a database and linked it with the software using JDBC API. We also created a web-page for documentation and help/feedback, and added it's link into the software's interface. 

Even though we couldn't complete this project the way we thought, we learnt a lot from it (and hence we have started working on our project since the beginning of our next semester) and we believe that this software idea is really useful for students all around and is an scalable idea.
