            1.1 PROJECT AIMS AND OBJECTIVES 
            <br>
            The project aims and objectives that will be achieved after completion of this project are discussed in this subchapter. The aims and objectives are as follows: 
            •	A separate login page for Students and Shopkeepers. 
            •	After Student login, they can find shops near them which are required. 
            •	After Shopkeeper login, they can add and update details about their shop. 
            <br>
             
                 BACKGROUND OF PROJECT 
                 <br>
             
              Student buddy (A virtual guardian away from home) is an application which should generally use in small area/town. An application helps students to find their required shops of various categories and saves the time. Students or user can also add their ratings/feedback which will help other students to select appropriate shop. Main aim of application is help the students about various shops present in their area and save the time. 
              <br> 
            Shopkeeper login is also there, they can improve their quality by valuable ratings and feedback. This is real time application which will surely help students and shopkeepers present in that particular area. As this application is computer based and contain just overviews of shops, so it is highly secure, safe and easy to use.
            <br>

            SYSTEM ANALYSIS 
            <br>

  
In this chapter, we will discuss and analyse about the developing process of Student buddy application including software requirement specification (SRS) and comparison between existing and proposed system. The functional and non-functional requirements are included in SRS part to provide complete description and overview of system requirement before the developing process is carried out.  
<br>
 
	2.1 	SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 
    <br>
                     PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

<br>
Previously such type of application doesn’t exist. An Admin first verifies the shop by aadhar number, mobile number, shop’s license etc.
As nothing personal information is there, Payment through application isn’t available now (surely we will plan about this in future), so it is highly safe and secure.
The main aim to help students or users by giving them various choices of shops near them and saves the time.
<br>
2.2 	SYSTEM OBJECTIVES 
<br>
•	Improvement in control and performance  <br>
The system should be bug free, error-less and should up to date. 
<br>
•	Save cost  <br>
After computerized system is implemented less human force will be required to maintain the application thus reducing the overall cost. 
<br>
•	Save time  <br>
Student/user is able to search its required shops by using few clicks of mouse and few search keywords thus saving his valuable time. 
<br>

2.3 	SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  <br>

3.	Performance : <br>
When a student buddy will be implemented user will easily access to nearby shops and  will be very faster.
<br>
4.	Maintainability : <br>
Thriving the application maintenance from the initial development means cutting the time & cost to determine and resolve the faults of the system in the future. <br>

5.	Scalability : <br>
Last but not the least, you have to look for a future-proof solution considering the scalability. It will define how the website can grow and increase its features and functionality without impacting the performance of your application.
<br>
2.3.2	FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS  <br>

1.	USER LOGIN  <br>
This feature used by the user to login into system. They are required to enter user id and password before they are allowed to enter the system .The user id and password will be verified and if invalid id is there user is allowed to not enter the system.  <br>
